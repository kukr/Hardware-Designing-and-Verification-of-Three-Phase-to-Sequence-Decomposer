### Abstract

Sequence components are basic tools that are widely used in power systems and industrial applications to enable convenient examination and analysis of 3-phased power networks under both balanced and unbalanced operating conditions. Typical unbalances are those caused by faults between the phases and/or ground, open phases and unbalanced loading such as static power equipment and single-phase devices.
The majority of articles published in past have focused on steady state applications of sequence components. Not much attention has been paid to methods of extracting the components quickly. This is crucial if one is to achieve a faster dynamic response. In this report we gave the brief introduction of how the sequence components can be extracted from 3-Phase using digital systems.
The method of extracting sequence components becomes problematic if base frequency is not known a priori. This problem can be resolved by continuously adapting the coefficients in discrete transfer function. As the frequency changes the coefficients are adapted and thus discrete transfer function properties becomes frequency independent.
In recent years, FPGAs are becoming more popular for hardware implementation because of their programmability and reduced development costs. This makes them ideal for rapid development and prototyping. So, we will be using FPGAs for the final model implementation which can later be designed into a PC.
