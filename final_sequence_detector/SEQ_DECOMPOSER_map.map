Slice Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Registers:                    57 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as Flip Flops:                  57
  Number of Slice LUTs:                         87 out of  28,800    1%
    Number used as logic:                       81 out of  28,800    1%
      Number using O6 output only:              22
      Number using O5 output only:              12
      Number using O5 and O6:                   47
    Number used as exclusive route-thru:         6
  Number of route-thrus:                        18

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                    27 out of   7,200    1%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:           87
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:            30 out of      87   34%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of      87    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          57 out of      87   65%
    Number of unique control sets:               5
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               3 out of  28,800    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

IO Utilization:
  Number of bonded IOBs:                        21 out of     480    4%
    Number of LOCed IOBs:                       21 out of      21  100%

Specific Feature Utilization:
  Number of BUFG/BUFGCTRLs:                      2 out of      32    6%
    Number used as BUFGs:                        2

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.48
